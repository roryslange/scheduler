# scheduler
## Description
scheduler is a full stack web app that provides services similar to Jira. It's main purpose is to serve as a Kanban board for teams working to organize tasks throughout a continuous development cycle. This app was created to provide me with experience using Spring Boot, a backend framework that I will be using in the future. This project's purpose is to provide a real-world context to allow me to use Spring Boot to it's full potential through development of a full stack application. 
## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Boot (web, JPA for database config, management, and repository functions)
- Firebase (authentication, firestore)

Feel free to explore this application, it is by no means finished, but it may be interesting to see my progress learning Sprint Boot! :)
